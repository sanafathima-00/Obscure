# Obscure ü§´

*An AI that thinks locally, acts silently, and adapts personally.*

**Obscure** is a stealthy, voice-first AI desktop assistant that runs locally on your machine. It is designed to be a private, powerful, and integrated companion that can see your screen, control your applications, and delegate complex tasks to web services and powerful AI models, all while respecting your privacy.

## ‚ú® Core Capabilities

  - **üó£Ô∏è Voice-First Interaction:** Fully operated by voice with high-quality, real-time speech recognition and natural text-to-speech output.
  - **üñ•Ô∏è Screen-Aware Vision:** Can read the content of your active window, providing summaries or answering questions about what's on screen.
  - **ü¶æ System & App Control:** Executes commands to open local applications (Notepad, Chrome, Spotify) and perform UI automation like typing text.
  - **üß† Hybrid AI Brain:**
      - Uses a fast, local LLM (**Phi-3 Mini**) for instant, private tasks.
      - Delegates complex questions to a powerful external AI (**Google Gemini**) for expert-level answers.
  - **üîå Extensible Automation via n8n:** Connects to a local [n8n](https://n8n.io/) server, giving it the ability to control hundreds of web services and APIs (e.g., Google Calendar, Slack, Notion) through webhook-driven workflows.
  - **üìù Persistent Memory:** Remembers past conversations using a local `memory.json` file, allowing for contextual follow-up questions.

## üöß Future Improvements (Roadmap)

  - **‚úÖ True Stealth Mode:** Implement the `CustomTkinter` + `pywin32` UI that runs as a background process and is invisible to screen captures.
  - **Hotkey Activation:** Trigger the assistant with a global keyboard shortcut instead of running it in a terminal.
  - **Complex UI Automation:** Build advanced `pyautogui` actions for multi-step tasks (e.g., controlling Spotify playback).
  - **Expanded n8n Workflows:** Add more skills by building workflows for Google Calendar, email, to-do lists, and more.
  - **Code Execution Agent:** Implement the "run and debug" feature for generated code.
